00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,685
Welcome back. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:05,325
you're going to use the Kotlin interpreter

3
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:08,234
to get comfortable with the basic language features.

4
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:10,919
It is best if you just follow along with us,

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,830
as we type out and explain the examples.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,149
To make this a bit more entertaining,

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,269
we will go at a good pace,

8
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,899
and we're going to wrap all of this into an aquarium.

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,149
Now, I've had aquarium since my aunt gave me one.

10
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,744
Plants and all when I was about nine.

11
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:30,144
There's everything in an aquarium,

12
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:31,600
to teach your Kotlin.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,725
Now, we couldn't really set up a big fancy aquarium here at the studio.

14
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:40,329
But, we hope you enjoy our small project.

15
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,585
I'm not really sure how Kotlin is like an aquarium,

16
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,929
but I bet we'll all find out by the end of this course.

17
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,560
Let's get started with the basics.
