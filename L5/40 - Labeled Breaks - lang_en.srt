00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,254
Kotlin has several ways of controlling flow.

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:06,509
You are already familiar with return which

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,019
returns from a function to its enclosing function.

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,994
Break is like return but for loops.

5
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:20,460
Kotlin gives you additional control over loops with what's called a labeled break.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,390
A break qualified with a label jumps to

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,460
the execution point right after the loop marked with that label.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,380
What happens since this function is that if I is greater than 10,

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,515
we break and resume execution at the label.

10
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:46,284
What this does is give you better control over nested loops.

11
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:50,589
Any expression in Kotlin may be marked with a label.

12
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:56,350
Labels have the form of an identifier followed by the add sign.

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,770
Check the grammar for more information on this.

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,945
To label an expression,

15
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:05,000
we just put a label in front of it.
