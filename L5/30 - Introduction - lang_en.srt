1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
You are more than halfway and in good shape to build

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,265
your very own aquarium with happy, healthy fish.

3
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:10,160
Don't forget, this course is, first and foremost,

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,044
about Kotlin, not aquarium care.

5
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:15,750
But there are so many more topics to cover,

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,175
and we don't have time to get deep into each of them.

7
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:21,089
Like you can create

8
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:26,144
a much better environment for your fish if you test the water quality regularly.

9
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:30,664
But what if your fish gets sick even if you do change the water?

10
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:34,545
How do you know what symptoms go with which disease,

11
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,255
and how do you treat it?

12
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:38,984
Does it matter what you feed your fish?

13
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:42,774
Can fish get vitamin deficiency or depression?

14
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:45,399
Do they have feelings?

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,015
Yes. Yes. That's a lot to learn,

16
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,469
and there's so much more Kotlin, too.

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,319
But this is a bootcamp about how to get you rolling with Kotlin,

18
00:00:56,319 --> 00:01:00,535
so you are ready for other courses that use Kotlin to do cool things.

19
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,504
For example, with phones.

20
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:05,590
So, what we can do is give you starting points,

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,484
and that's what we're going to do in this lesson.

22
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:10,090
We're going to kick you off on

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,890
nine different topics and set you free to continue exploring on your own.

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,569
Among other things, we're going to cover pairs and more on collections,

25
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,739
show you how to do constants in Kotlin,

26
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:24,234
sneak a peek at annotations,

27
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:26,144
dive deep into generics,

28
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:28,884
and the most scary one, label breaks.

29
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:33,130
Generics is an advanced topic but super relevant for Kotlin,

30
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,829
and we'll walk you through it one step at a time.

31
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,329
And in the end, our fish will live in a perfect water supply.
