1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,485
All right, we have an aquarium and decorations

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:09,105
and equipment and we can take pretty good care of our fish by now.

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:15,000
There is just one important thing missing, the fish.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,984
It's the fish that we went through all this trouble for.

5
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:24,984
Everything else, while useful and beautiful and fascinating, it's scaffolding.

6
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:28,089
Our course so far is a little bit like this.

7
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,899
Everything we learned is fundamental to writing good Kotlin code,

8
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:36,454
but we think that the fish of Kotlin are its functional features.

9
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:39,929
The ability to multiply, change using extensions,

10
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,179
which we've already covered,

11
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,689
higher order functions, and lambdas.

12
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:49,439
So, we'll see you in the final lesson where there will be lots of fish.
