1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,705
And that's that, the end of Kotlin bootcamp.

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:07,050
The end of the beginning of your journey with Kotlin.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,875
We've covered everything from the very basics of operations,

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,500
to the very Kotlin-specific Lambdas.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,969
We hope you enjoy accomplishing more functionality writing less code.

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:22,154
We hope you are a little bit excited about this cool language,

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,565
and we hope you had fun.

8
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:27,339
We've touched on everything you need to start

9
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:30,384
building your own apps and explore on your own.

10
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:35,090
There's definitely so much more and it's best to learn that as you need it.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,130
The best way to become a Kotlin expert is through practice.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,600
So go, make your own aquarium.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,039
In Kotlin.
