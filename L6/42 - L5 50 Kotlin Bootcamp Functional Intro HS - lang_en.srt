00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,024
Welcome to lesson five;

2
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:04,140
the final lesson of this course.

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,219
This lesson is all about fish because for most people,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,325
the main attraction of an aquarium are its fish.

5
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:15,449
So, how about we try our hands at picking and breeding some fish?

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,019
So, we'll also do a little bit of Kotlin on the side.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,259
We'll revisit Lambdas and go a little deeper because they

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,830
are one of the essential specialities of Kotlin.

9
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,513
This leads to higher order functions,

10
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:32,490
basically functions that take functions as arguments.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,325
This makes Kotlin extremely flexible.

12
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:39,450
We'll talk about SAM or single abstract methods,

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,950
as well as inline.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,935
I'm looking forward to finding out more about SAM.

15
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:46,890
If they have an aquarium, I'm all for it.

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,289
To close out, we'll play with filters;

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,990
the Kotlin type not the aquarium type.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,840
We'll talk a little bit about the standard library,

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,705
and where you can go if you want to study more fish.

20
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:58,799
Kotlin.
