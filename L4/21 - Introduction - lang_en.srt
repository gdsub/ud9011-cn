00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
Welcome back. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,854
we are going to dive into object oriented programming in Kotlin.

3
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:09,419
Let's refresh a bit of terminology,

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,394
so that we're all calling the same things by the same names.

5
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:16,274
Classes are blueprints for objects.

6
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:19,125
Like this is an aquarium blueprint.

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:24,990
Objects are instances of classes that is the actual aquarium.

8
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,949
Properties are characteristics of classes such as the length,

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,544
width, and height of an aquarium.

10
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:35,310
Methods are the functionality of the class,

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,480
what the object they could do for example, fill with water.

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,744
Interfaces are a specification that a class can implement.

13
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:49,168
For example, cleaning is common not just to aquariums,

14
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:52,559
and cleaning generally happens in similar ways.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,270
So, we can have an interface clean,

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,660
and aquarium could implement it.

17
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,789
In the following screencast,

18
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,319
we're going to build some classes around our aquarium exploring all those concepts.
