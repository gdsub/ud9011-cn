1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,285
Wow, this was a hefty class.

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:05,974
Let's get up and do some stretches.

3
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:09,594
I wonder, do fish do stretches?

4
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:13,780
What kind of stretches do you think fish would do?

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,995
So, in this lesson,

6
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:23,164
we learned Kotlin's way of doing object-oriented programming with classes,

7
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,859
abstract classes, and interfaces,

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,579
and we added bits and pieces to your aquarium.

9
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:35,030
I think the best thing you can do for yourself after this lesson is practice.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,570
Have some fun, write some code,

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,795
whether it's turning this example into coherent program,

12
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,600
or writing that game you've been putting off,

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,960
and then come back for the next lesson where we'll have

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,564
a whole basket of Kotlin goodness for you, including-

15
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:54,280
Constants, collections, and generics.
