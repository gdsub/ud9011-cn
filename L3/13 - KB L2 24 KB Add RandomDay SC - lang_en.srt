1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
Now, that you've made a file with a main function,

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,285
it's time to define some more functions.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:12,070
Let's add a function for our AMS that feeds the fish different foods on different days.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,580
So, let's define a function,

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,870
feeds the fish that will hold our AMS logic and call it from main.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,390
Let's make feed the fish to something.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,045
Our goal is to pick a random day of the week and output a different food for each day.

8
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:32,295
We'll build it one step at a time.

9
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:35,660
First, let's put the basic structure together.

10
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:38,759
Inside the body of the feed the fish function,

11
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,214
add a variable called "day" and assign it to "Tuesday".

12
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:47,745
To start with, our AMS will only know about Tuesday.

13
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:52,379
Add a second variable called food that is pellet's.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,245
That's what fish eat on Tuesdays.

15
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:59,534
Lastly, add a print statement using a string template.

16
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:02,144
This will print out today and food.

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,314
Let's run our program again and you'll see the output,

18
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:09,939
today is Tuesday and the fish eat pellet's.

19
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:13,155
Extending our functionality, we want to select

20
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:16,920
a random day of the week each time this program is run.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,725
Below feed the fish,

22
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:25,009
create a function called random day with no arguments and it returns a string.

23
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,340
We are using strings for the weekdays in this example because it's

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,585
more readable and the final destination is to print the value.

25
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:38,174
Inside the function, create a list of weekdays as strings.

26
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:44,325
Below that, returned a value at a randomly chosen index inside the list.

27
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:49,045
Random gives us an error because we have to import the library.

28
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:52,685
Here are some things to notice about this finished function.

29
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:57,400
You are importing a Java library for random because under the hood,

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,655
Kotlin works seamlessly with Java libraries.

31
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,650
In the return statement,

32
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,375
we get a random number between zero and six.

33
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,210
Seven is the boundary and excluded.

34
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,485
And then, we return the associated weekday.

35
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:14,145
In feed the fish,

36
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:17,770
replace Tuesday with a call to random day.

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,890
When we run the program again a couple of times,

38
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:24,649
we see a random day of the week in the output.
