00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,254
Now, that we've flown through the very basics,

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:08,625
you are ready to write some Kotlin code that actually does something useful.

3
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:12,644
Our aquarium could really use some decorations.

4
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:17,730
More importantly, it needs an AMS,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,240
an aquarium management system.

6
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,429
This AMS will feed the fish and change the water for you.

7
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:29,309
And of course, the AMS needs a Kotlin program to run properly.

8
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,140
So, in this lesson,

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,259
you're going to write parts of a Kotlin program with

10
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,439
functions and functionality to manage an aquarium.
