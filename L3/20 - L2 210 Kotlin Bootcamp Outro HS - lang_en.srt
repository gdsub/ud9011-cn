1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
This last example shows one of the challenges,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,634
and features of Kotlin.

3
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:08,039
You can do most things in more than one way, correctly.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,009
And you can often compact code significantly.

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,019
Sometimes that helps readability,

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,364
and even performance, and sometimes it doesn't.

7
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,439
Finding the most compact,

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,115
or most readable version can be like a puzzle.

9
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:22,539
Because I'm still learning,

10
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,919
this means that I often write code in the easiest, almost familiar way,

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,315
and then I will play with it, changing it,

12
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:30,839
like a Rubik's Cube,

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,314
until I find the best way for what I want to accomplish.

14
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:39,054
I did say play because sometimes I really get into it, and it's fun.

15
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:41,155
So, have fun practicing,

16
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:43,270
and we'll see you for the next lesson,

17
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,580
where we'll look at classes.
